        <img id="profile" src="./img/profile_2.jpg" />
        <p>
            My name is Munaz Rahman and I am a student with an amazing passion for technology pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for technology began when I picked up a book titled <a class="book-title" target="_blank" href="http://amzn.com/0976011115">Look Mom! I Built My Own Web Site</a> from my local library. At a young age, I immediately fell in love with the ability to design and create something of my own by writing lines of code. This truly sparked my love for programming so I continued to advance my skills in other programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of programming I love building things using technology. I've participated in various robotic clubs, love attending hackathons and also working on projects of my own. I truly believe that technology, both through software and hardware, can be used to solve many problems faced by people today.

                Meetr is an application aimed to help businesses conserve more energy by controlling the Nest smart thermostat in their office rooms based on their meeting times. By disabling the heating or air conditioning while meetings are not in effect, businesses can save more energy and money.

            <img src="./img/bukkit.png" />
            <p>
                My past addiction to Minecraft has led me to create various plugins that can be used on Minecraft servers. These plugins add content to the game by creating new minigames within the game itself without the need for users to download any additional files.
