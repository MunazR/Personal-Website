        <p>
            My name is <span class="thick">Munaz Rahman</span> and I am a student with an amazing passion for technology pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion for technology began when I picked up a book titled <a class="book-title" target="_blank" href="http://amzn.com/0976011115">Look Mom! I Built My Own Web Site</a> from my local library when I was younger. I immediately fell in love with the ability to design and create something of my own by writing lines of code. This truly sparked my love for programming as I continued to advance my skills in other programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of programming I love building things using technology. I've participated in various robotic clubs and I love attending hackathons. I've worked with my team members to create innovative solutions and have also competed in different competitions. I truly believe that technology, both through software and hardware, can be used to solve many problems faced by people today.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also in a co-operative program and am constantly looking for new opportunities to grow my skills while contributing to your business. Take a look at my <span class="thick">resume</span> <a target="_blank" href="./files/resume.pdf">here</a> and feel free to contact me below!

            <h3>Lets | Web Application</h3>
            <img src="./img/lets.png" />
            <p>Lets is a web application I developed for my Hack the North 2015 project. It provides a medium for students to easily share and create events with other students. It utilizes <span class="thick">Facebook</span> to authenticate users, <span class="thick">Google Maps</span> to share and choose locations and <span class="thick">FireBase</span> to handle all backend services without actually having a backend.

            <h3>WatApp | Pebble Smart Watch App</h3>
            <img src="./img/watapp.png" />
            <p>WatApp provides uWaterloo students with the information they need on their wrists. Students can view information on food locations, employer information sessions, weather and more. It utilizes <span class="thick">Pebble.js</span> and the <span class="thick">University of Waterloo Open Data API</span> to perform its functionality. View the source code <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MunazR/WatApp">here</a>, view it on the Pebble appstore <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55da162a264607d00d000021">here</a> and download it from your smartphone <a target="_blank" href="pebble://appstore/55da162a264607d00d000021">here</a>.

            <h3>Bukkit Plugins for Minecraft Servers</h3>
            <img src="./img/bukkit.png" />
            <p>This project is my personal favorite and has led me to learn many things. My addiction to Minecraft, a popular game on PC, led me to create hundreds of YouTube videos, manage a Minecraft server and develop many Bukkit plugins. With over 70k subscribers and 13M views on my YouTube channel I was able to drive over 150k unique players to my server, previously known as IPocketIsland. To develop plugins for this server I used <span class="thick">Bukkit</span> and <span class="thick">MySQL</span>. View my YouTube channel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/IPocketIsland/featured">here</a> and the source code for my plugins <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MunazR/Minecraft-Plugins">here</a>.

            <h3>Norton | Xbox 360 and PC Game</h3>
            <img src="./img/xna.png" />
            <p>Norton is a top-down shooter developed using Microsoft's <span class="thick">XNA Game Studio</span> and is playable on XBox 360 and PC. It is multi-leveled game that required thousands of lines of code, various sprites and more. This project truly was one of my greatest challenges given the time constraint.
